AirBnB clone - The console

Welcome to our  AirBnB clone group project!
This project initiates the development of an AirBnB clone by creating a command interpreter. Modeled after a Shell, the interpreter facilitates the management of AirBnB objects. A parent class, BaseModel, is implemented for object initialization, serialization, and deserialization. The project includes the creation of classes representing AirBnB entities (User, State, City, Place) inheriting from BaseModel. An abstracted file storage engine is developed, enabling object storage and retrieval. Unit tests ensure the reliability of classes and the storage engine. The command interpreter allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects, laying the foundation for subsequent web application functionalities.
